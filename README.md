C# Practice. It's a practical application that I can use for a tabletop game that I play.

In short, I run a tabletop game here and there, that I use my own rules for, and this application can help me keep track of data, as well as running various calculations for me so I don't have to use my head every time.

Upon this project's completion, it should be able to read in a text file of characters, and their data, creating a list out of it.

Using this list, it will allow data manipulation in various ways, whether it is calculating what I need, or changing it directly for whatever reason that may be necessary. Additionally, the program will also allow me to display the current data, add new characters to the text files, or remove characters from it, so I should not have to directly tamper with the files to get what I may need.

After any forms of data manipulation happen, the text file will save as both a new input file and output file (mainly to create an easy-to-read copy for others), so the data will be retained even if the application is closed.

Once again, this is serving as practice for C#, so updates to code may come for the purposes of simply rewriting some lines of code, reasons which may include using better coding practices, more efficient algorithms, etc.
